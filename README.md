**Cricket Data Analytics 🏏**
*Tools: Power BI, Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook*

This project focuses on analyzing T20 Cricket World Cup data to provide deep insights into player performances and match outcomes. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore detailed statistics and even select their ideal playing XI from the tournament’s player pool.

You can explore the dashboard by downloading the `.pbix` file from the repository and opening it in Power BI Desktop on your computer.

**Project Workflow:**

* 📝 Defining project goals and key requirements
* 🌐 Gathering data through web scraping from the ESPN Cricinfo website
* 🧹 Cleaning and preprocessing raw data using Python’s Pandas library
* 🪄 Performing data transformations within Power Query in Power BI
* ⚒️ Building data models and custom parameters using DAX formulas
* 📊 Designing and fine-tuning the dashboard for effective visualization and interaction
